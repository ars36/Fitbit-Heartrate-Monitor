# Fitbit Heartrate Monitor (Work In Progress)
An application that interacts with [Fitbit's](https://fitbit.com/) [Web API](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api) to retrieve information on a person's heart rate. If the heart rate goes below or above a certain threshold, certain actions may be performed such as sending an email or HTTP request.

## Motives
I currently live with a family member who has health issues with their heart and high blood pressure. I wanted to make something to alert my other family members and I if this person's heart rate is abnormally low or high.
